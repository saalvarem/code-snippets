# Code Snippets Repository

This repository contains small code snippets that implement the same simple functionality in various programming languages. It serves as a reference for developers looking for examples in different languages.

## Programming Languages

- C#
- Python
- TypeScript

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Not all snippets may be available in all languages.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by language, and each language has its own directory:

- `csharp`: C# examples
- `python`: Python examples
- `typescript`: TypeScript examples

## Usage

These snippets are intended for reference purposes or as study materials and may cover common programming tasks. They are simple coding exercises I use to practice code syntax of different languages.

They are not intended to be complete applications and are likely not production-ready. Please review and test them carefully before using them in your own projects.
